A view that positions itself based on the scrolling of its superview.
Recommended use is as a header or footer view for a UITableView.

This view can float in place (FloatAtTop, FloatAtBottom, or FloatInPlace)
regardless of its superview's scrolling or it can stick to the top (FloatAboveContent) or
bottom (FloatBelowContent) of the superview until the content is scrolled and pushes it out of view.
